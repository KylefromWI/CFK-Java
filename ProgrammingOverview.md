Hello all. This file will include the concepts we've touched on so far. 

# Command Prompt
the way to directly interface with your Windows system. Alternately called the terminal or the console

## Commands
Here are the command prompt commands we've been using

    * dir - Short for "directory". Tells you what 'folder' you're currently inside of and lists the contents of that folder    
    * cd <destination> - Short for "change directory". Changes your location
    * javac <fileName>.java - compiles your code. Outputs a '<fileName>.class' file. Remember to include the '.java' extension of your program's name
    * java <className> - executes a .class file. Think of this command as saying "Do java on this file"

Java information
    Making a program
        remember to save your file as a .java
        your file's name must be the same as the first class that you create
    

# Common problems:
    1. Did you forget a semicolon?
    2. Have you saved the changes you made before rerunning your code? Have you recompiled those changes?
    3. Common Typos
        * Are all your variables spelled the same?
        * Is everything the correct case? (upper vs lower)
        * did you use the right braces/parenthesis?
    4. When Compiling/running your code
        * Are you in the right directory? (Kinda like: You should be in your kitchen before you start cooking)
        * if you're compiling, did you include the '.java' part of your destination file?
        * if you're executing the code you've compiled, did you remove the '.class' part?
