Hello all. This file will include the concepts we've touched on so far. 
Currently it is a WIP (Work In Progress)

Command Prompt: the way to directly interface with your Windows system. Alternately called the terminal or the console

Command prompt commands we've been using

    dir : tells you what 'folder' you're currently inside of. Lists the contents of your current folder
          short for "directory", which is the technical name for folder
          
    cd <destination> : changes your location. Short for "change directory"
    
    javac <fileName>.java : compiles your code. 
          Outputs a .class file with the same name as your .java file
          Remember to include the .java extension of your program's name
    
    java <className> : executes a .class file. 
          Think of this command as saying "Do java on this file"
