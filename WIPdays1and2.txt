Hello all. This file will include the concepts we've touched on so far. 
Currently it is a WIP (Work In Progress)

Command Prompt: the way to directly interface with your Windows system. Alternately called the terminal or the console

Command prompt commands we've been using

    dir : tells you what 'folder' you're currently inside of. Lists the contents of your current folder
          short for "directory", which is the technical name for folder
          
    cd <destination> : changes your location. Short for "change directory"
    
    javac <fileName>.java : compiles your code. 
          Outputs a .class file with the same name as your .java file
          Remember to include the .java extension of your program's name
    
    java <className> : executes a .class file. 

    Think of this command as saying "Do java on this file"

Java information
    Making a program
        remember to save your file as a .java
        your file's name must be the same as the first class that you create
    

Common problems:
    When Compiling/running your code
        Are you in the right directory? (Kinda like: You should be in your kitchen before you start cooking)
        if you're compiling, did you include the '.java' part of your destination file?
        if you're executing the code you've compiled, did you remove the '.class' part?
    While coding:
        Typos
            Are things spelled the same where they're needed?
            Is everything correctly either uppercase or lower case?
            Did you use the right braces or parentheses?
        Semicolons: Are they at the end of all your lines of code?
